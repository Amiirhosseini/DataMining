# DataMining

This repository contains several Jupyter Notebook files that I created as part of my Data Mining course homework. I used these notebooks to manipulate data and write code in Python. The notebooks contain detailed explanations of the code and the data manipulation techniques I used. also you can visit our data mining project here: <a/>https://github.com/Amiirhosseini/Data-Mining-Project
